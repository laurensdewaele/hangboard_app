 ## Transitions

Hero transitions for going from my 'add new workout' to the workout screen that takes the gradient.
Add transition from card expand to collapse.

## Hitboxes buttons

See if you can make them bigger than their containers.

## Smaller width screens

Review the app on smaller and larger screens.

## Implement a feedback button

##  Stop all globals (singletons as well)

## Perf

Performance seems acceptable at the moment.
Except for the initial dialog.
