## Day

I'm glad I decided to sacrifice a little of my other goals and put in more time into this project.
It's been great so far. Made a lot of good progress today and am happy.

The whole workout thing proved to be worthwhile. 
It's now decently put together imo. And good performance.

Tomorrow I need to take a look at how to catch the errors,
probably on an app wide base.

Have a singleton toast service.
