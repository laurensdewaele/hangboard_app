## New to hangboarding

The best way forward is to dive in and create your own workout.
It's more effective than choosing a pre-made workout, made by someone else.
Only you can know and figure out what you can hang.
Trust yourself, and listen to your body.

Start with our beginner workout and train the 3 most important grip types:
- Open hand drag 3x
- Half crimp 3x 
- 3 finger drag 3x

And simply hang on for as long as you can.
If you can go above 30s, try a smaller edge size.

Don't worry about not knowing the hang time in advance,
you can alter them during your workout by clicking on 'log hangs' when pausing the workout.

For you next workout, edit the workout and alter the hang time values to what you were able to hang.




##Reminder to yourself: 
Just write down the basics or as little as possible and refer them to the links
that do a better job (maybe).


## About.

This app is tailored for the broad audience.
We wanted it to be accessible for everyone, from hardcore pro to someone just starting out hang boarding.

Therefore, we tried our best to make the app highly customisable so it works for everyone. 
However, when starting out, all these variables can seem a bit overwhelming.

The following section provides some guidance on hang boarding we believe is useful.

## Hangboarding.


FORM!

This section is for everyone who’s just starting out and unsure of what to do.

There’s a lot of information on the internet about how to hangboard. 
This is a good thing. However, sometimes the information out there can be contradicting. 
It can feel like you’re lost in the woods sometimes. Which direction do I take? Will this be optimal?

We’re here to tell you that you’re lucky!
Literally any path you take will provide you with a ton of gains.
This is because your body hasn’t yet adapted to hangboarding thus

## Protocols 

We were doubting about wether to include some protocols in the app but eventually decided against it. 
Why? There’s no magic protocol. They all work up until a certain point, and then they don’t anymore. 
You’ve plateaued with it and you need to switch them up.

There has been some science done on certain protocols, but they’re not definitive.
We’re still in the early stages of climbing specific research here. 
Things will change.

There’s also one and half million different protocols out there that all have their use.
It’s next to impossible to decide which ones to include and which ones te leave out.

It’s up to you to experiment, be inventive, and find out what fits for you and your climbing specific goals.
