# About

This app was built as a tool to help you progress your finger strength.
Finger strength progression requires a lot of time. Therefor, logging your 
practice and being able to visualize your progression is invaluable.

The app is built for allowing you to enter any kind of workout variable. Be it specific
mixed grips, custom edge sizes, body weight, you name it. We'll do our best so you can log everything your heart desires.

After you've done a hang, or at the end of a workout, you can enter the exact amount of time you've hung.
Imagine you had to hang on for 10 seconds, but only managed to do 8. It's important to log this, and we've 
made sure you can. This helps you set variables for your next workout and track your progression more efficiently.

This app will not provide you with a myriad of different workouts or protocols, only the most basic ones to get you started. 
A workout has to be tailored to the individual, and it's impossible for us to know all the variables 
it takes to design a balanced workout for that specific individual. Be it age, climbing age, sleep, stress, 
weight, the list goes on... Therefor, the best way forward for us is to help the individual to design it themselves.

# New to hangboarding.

As mentioned in the previous section, if you're new, we believe the best way forward for you is to simply start hanging, not by looking for the perfect workout plan. 
The perfect plan doesn't exist. It's never going to be tailored specifically for you. You need to have a workout that you're
comfortable with and that is not too hard and not too easy. Only you can know! No one else!

If you're new, the best way is the easiest way and you're lucky, because no matter what kind of training you do, you'll
improve anyway!

Trust yourself and jump right in. We recommend you begin with the density hang workout. Simply hang on for as long as you can. 
Remember to warm up properly and hang with proper form. See the link section for a video on warming up and applying proper form.
After a hang, rest for as long as it takes to reproduce the same max effort (usually 3 - 5min). On a rest phase, you can tap to pause, and log the amount of time you were able to hang on.

For your next workout on a later date, look back at your previous workout to see what you were able to hang, and edit the workout accordingly.

If you can easily hang on for 30 seconds on a specific grip and hold type, try a smaller edge.

That's all there is to know for now. A little bit goes a long way. Ease into the training. Start by doing it once a week.
Remember that finger strength adaptations require a lot of time, so you'll have to cultivate some patience. Don't rush things, or risk getting injured.
You're in it for the long haul here. 

If you notice you're starting to plateau and you've been doing a protocol for at least 6 weeks, try a different one.

# Protocols

## Density hangs

Simply hang on for as long as you can. Look for a range between 20 - 40 seconds. If 20s is too much, don't sweat it, do less or increase the edge depth.

## Max hangs

Hang so you're just about able to hang on for 10 seconds. It should be just about max effort.
If it's too easy, go to a smaller edge size or add weight.

## Repeaters

This is not suitable for beginners, because you need to calculate your load correctly,
thus often times requiring a pulley system. We prefer the simplicity of no pulley systems or added weight whilst starting out.

For beginners, the weight load should be about 50% of your maximum voluntary contraction.
For advanced climbers, 60% - 80% of your MVC.
You calculate your maximum voluntary contraction by finding the maximum amount of load you can hang for 7s, for each grip type.
E.g. if you can hang an additional 30kg for a half crimp grip for 7 seconds, and you weigh 70kg, your total max load is 100kg.
For repeaters, starting out, you want half that, so you need to subtract 20kg (70kg - 20kg = 50kg) with a pulley system.
The exact load determination for each grip position can be tricky, but as long as you get pumped in the end and still manage to complete all the hangs, you're on the right track.
Adjust the rep/set count accordingly.
