## Matt Pincus on training beta notes:

Hangboard is a pure strength tool.
So that’s why he prefers the max weight protocol.
Repeaters are valuable if you’re a boulderer trying to move into sport or if you 
Don’t have climbing access.
Beginners: A little bit goes a long way. Easee into it. Be careful. 1x/week if you can climb.

Max weight protocol 10s.
Rest as much as you need in between.

Repeaters.
7s on 3s off.

## Dave Macleod video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKE5VH5-qg)

This is a strength training tool. 
You should pull hard and load your fingers maximally. 
Around 7 to 10s per hang.
Push it to failure.
If you can’t deliver close to your max every time, stop training.

1) Warmup 
     E.g. 5 - 10 pull-ups on the biggest holds to get everything going.
    Progress in difficulty for the next 5 to 15 minutes. 
    Feel free to use a chair underneath or something else if it’s too hard.

2) Grips types:

    - 4 fingers open hand
    - half crimp
    - 3 fingers open hang or another name 3 fingers drag

3) 3 to 5 sets per grip type.



Once you’ve progressed in bit on the main grip types you can do other grips.
E.g. 2 finger pockets (middle, back, front).
Or you could also do pull-ups / front levers and 1 arm pull-ups.

Finding the right intensity is a matter of being inventive and experimenting.
2 arm hangs => add weight.
1 arm hangs => reduce weight with pulley.
Mixed grips => Open hand + 1 mono.


Rest as long as it takes to reproduce the same max effort.

How to know if you’re overtraining? 
This will show up on your performance. If your performance is dropping, you’re under recovered.

Finger strength gains are slow so you’re in for the long haul here.
Do them when you’re rested and can produce high effort.

Avoid injury!
Don’t jump but graduallly build up tension
Don’t swing, a finger might slip and then you might be in for a pulley injury.
Chalk up reduces the chances of slipping.

Eva lopez interview on power company podcast nr 118

If you’re a beginner it’s better to start on minimal edges instead of weighted hangs.
Best beginner method is the easiest.
Because you’re going to improve anyway. 
Don’t pick the advanced stuf.
The most approachable easiest method!

When you’re plateauing, just change something!

Strength depends on several factors.
Signal to muscle.
Way muscles connect and synchronise.
Motor firing and recruitment.
Nr of fibers being activated.
=> All those factors are neural adaptations in a short amount of time. (Days / weeks).

Structural changes => capularisation and hyportrophy and glycogen stores refillment. Plus enzymes and metabolic pathways.
Structural changes means you’re body need to create them and that takes a lot of time.
Several weeks.
Minimum of 6 weeks 

First you need to make the neural changes.

Dude says he prefers these because they’re shorted than the structural changes. (For his clients).
Neural hanging workout needs to be very intens and a short hang with long rest. And short volume.

Structural, e.g. repeaters / intermittent hangs, you do it in short time. 
3-5 sets 4 reps 10son 5off 1 minute between sets. => 5 / 6 minutes finished workout.
Only 1 grip type because afterwards they go climbing.

Hangboard in the morning => climb in the evening most benefit.

When you’re talking about power training it’s key to be fresh!!
(I think this depends on level because when you’re a beginner the strength isn’t the optimal progression).

When she does power endurance / endurance she does repeaters.
When she does power and bouldering => max hangs.

There is no perfect protocol, no best method.
You’re going to reach a plateau.

If you’re a beginner and you’re using advanced methods you’re shortening your long term improvements.
With untrained people, any method produces a lot of results.
So pick the easiest!!!
The most comfortable !!!!!

12s hang and then lower 10 and then 8 and then maybe 15 again, then 20.

Then change to repeaters.

Switch it uppp.

You’re body will create new adaptations.

You need to pay attention to your training. 

Repeaters require more weeks for structural changes.
In the long term you need to combine


1) Be motivated enough 
2) Think long term
3) Don’t get injured.
4) Forget about the mainstream. Forget about the videos you see online.

Start where you are. Be it fingerboarding or campussing ( don’t do this lol ).
PATIENCE is key!
