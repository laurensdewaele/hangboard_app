- Welcome
- Congratulate them on downloading the best hangboarding app, 
  and props to them for wanting to improve the most important asset of climbing, 
  finger strength. This is the safest way to do it (controlled environment).

- It's the safest way to increase your finger strenght, it's a controller environment.
- Explain them what best to do.

  you will see gains anyhow.
- There's been little to no research on the effectiveness of protocols, just pick one and switch it up after 
  6 - 8 weeks.
